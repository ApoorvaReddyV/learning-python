# 🏝️ Treasure Island - A Python Text Adventure Game

# This is a simple text-based adventure game where the player makes choices 
# at different stages to find a hidden treasure. Each choice leads the player 
# closer to the treasure — or to a game-over scenario.

# Concepts Used:
# - Handling user input with `input()`
# - Using `.lower()` for input normalization
# - Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, `else`
# - Basic storytelling with ASCII art
#
# 🎮 How to Play:
# Run the script in a Python environment. You'll be asked to make choices like:
# - Left or Right
# - Wait or Swim
# - Pick a door color (Red, Yellow, Blue)
